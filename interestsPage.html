    <h1>Hobbies/Interests Page</h1>
    <h2>Quick About Me</h2>
      <p>I have a lot of interests and hobbies I like to do in my free time, including 
      things like videogames, movies, art, hanging with friends, and many other things. I also 
      tend to gain quickly gain interests in things that I never have before, usually due to 
      watching some form of entertainment that revolves around that subject. Currently I am 
      still finding new things to do and take up an interest in, so I am open to many new 
      things!

    <h2>Video Games</h2>

      <p>I am currently a console player, I play on my PlayStation 4.  I have played on many 
      different systems before, including PS2, PS3, PSP, while I've played a tiny bit on the 
      Gameboy, Nintendo3DS, Xbox, and barely on a gaming pc. I used to play a game on my phone, 
      but then that phone became damaged and trying to recover the account became useless. I 
      play a lot of multiplayer and co-op games with my friends to pass the time like For Honor and 
      Titanfall 2, or Bloodborne and Dark Souls 3(which have become favorites to play).  Although 
      I like playing with my friends online, I love to play games focused around their campaigns, 
      like Horizon Zero Dawn, God of War, or the Dishonored franchise. Indie games are also 
      welcome, and are a great breather from other big budget games. Any game that has multiple 
      endings dictated by the choices you make during your playthrough has a big thumbs up 
      from me as well.  Although I've played many games already, there's still so many that 
      I haven't even heard of, and classics I haven't gotten to.

    <h2>Fitness</h2>
    <img src ="XCImageResized.jpg" alt="cross country">
      <p>I grew up playing sports, so I've always loved exercise and any physical activity really. 
      One of my first passions I had was cross country, it gave me such an accomplished feeling 
      that I had never felt before. Every time I set a new PR or overcame any difficulty, it 
      filled me with pride and even more determination to become better. One of the great things 
      about it that made me enjoy it more than other sports I played growing up is that you can 
      literally see your progression. In elementary and in high school, times were posted on 
      a website so you could keep track of how you were doing.  The place you came in at the meet 
      was also very motivating, so you could try harder to get higher. My brothers got me into 
      weightlifting around the 2nd half of high school. Ever since then, I've been working out, 
      going to my local YMCA gym or just using the weights in my basement. Since college started 
      I haven't been able to workout nearly as much, but I can look forward toward the breaks so 
      I can start going back to the gym to lift with my buddies.

    <h2>Film/Long Form TV</h2>
    <img src="movieImage.jpg" alt="No Country for Old Men movie">
      <p>I don't really know where exactly my love for cinema and long form television came from. 
      I think sometime in my early teens, my family got Netflix, and I finally got access to all 
      the shows and movies I had been missing out on (or so I thought; I had never had cable, and 
      back then I thought that Netflix had everything on it.).  After this, I got into multiple 
      shows, and started watching movies. I soon realized a ton of the movies I wished to see 
      weren't on Netflix, so I just decided one summer that I would rent all the movies I had 
      never seen.  Then I took 2 film classes at my high school, where we made and analyzed films. 
      Ever since then, I've had a big passion for movies, and I go all the time with friends, or 
      just by myself (everyone is working[I need a job]). Long form TV is also great too, it's 
      just a story stretched out into multiple seasons instead of 2 hours, which is great for me 
      because I can have a show keep me entertained for far longer than a movie.
