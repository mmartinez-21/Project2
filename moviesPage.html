    <p>If you've visited my page talking about my interests and hobbies, you'll know that 
    I really like movies and shows. This page is just me reviewing a couple movies and shows 
    that I thought are interesting, and are worth talking about.

    <p>I just recently watched the entire show over winter break, and I must say, it was 
    awesome. I know that most people tend to focus on how bad season 8 was when thinking of 
    the show, but it's also important to remember how good most of the other seasons were. 
    When I started watching and enjoying the show, I was so glad each episode was really long. 
    It was a great experience and although season 8 gave the show a trash ending, you can 
    really appreciate the rest of it.

    <p>This is one of the first films that I have ever watched that truly made me feel so 
    nervous and uneasy, but also invested into the story.  I think this film is heavily 
    underrated and knowing that many people prefer Shyamalan's other movies like <strong> The 
    Sixth Sense</strong> makes me want to watch them as well. It's a really underrated movie 
    and if anyone is into suspense movies, this is my go to recommendation.

    <p>This film really surprised me. I thought it was going to be a normal action movie, but 
    throughout the movie, it felt like it was so much more, with the fantastic ending sealing 
    the deal. I was really impressed. The best description I can give for this movie is 
    that it's a better version of the movie <strong>Venom</strong>. The premise is pretty 
    similar, and even the lead actors look the same.

    <p>This film was a spectacle, holy cow. Had some very awesome cinematography, very unique 
    and gave off the creepy vibes that the movie was going for. Willem Dafoe was just 
    awesome in this movie, his Neptune's curse monologue was so over the top and executed 
    perfectly at the same time. If you're unsure about seeing this film, it's one of those 
    films that's <em>very</em> open to interpretation, and definitely has a lot going on in 
    between the lines.
